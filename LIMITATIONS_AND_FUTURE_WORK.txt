Project Analysis: Limitations and Future Potential:
        This document outlines the current limitations of the Flood Prediction Model as a proof-of-concept and provides a strategic roadmap for its evolution into a production-grade service.

Part 1: Current Limitations and Known Issues
While the project successfully demonstrates an end-to-end MLOps workflow, several simplifications were made that a production deployment would need to address.
    Synthetic Hydrological Data:
        Issue: The model's river_discharge_m3s feature is not sourced from a live API; it's a placeholder created via forward-filling.
        Impact: The model is not learning from real, location-specific river flow data, a critical factor in flood prediction.
    Generalized Ground Truth:
        Issue: The training data is generated by labeling a wide area (150km radius) and time window (14 days) around a small set of just seven historical floods.
        Impact: This broad-brush approach may introduce noise, as data points distant from the flood's epicenter may not be representative of flood precursors.
    Simplified Terrain Analysis:
        Issue: The slope_degrees feature is calculated using a simplistic point-difference method.
        Impact: This is a localized approximation and lacks the precision of calculations derived from a high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM).
    Prediction Demo Disconnect:
        Issue: The prediction demo (main_predict.py) uses hard-coded, high-realism sample data, including a river_discharge_m3s value that the current data pipeline does not actually collect.
        Impact: This creates a disconnect, as the data required for a real-time, high-risk prediction cannot be sourced by the existing system.

Part 2: Roadmap for Production-Grade Service
Transitioning this project into a reliable, scalable service requires a multi-disciplinary effort focused on three key phases. The estimated timeline for a dedicated team of 4-6 professionals is 12-18 months.
    Phase 1: Data Foundation & Core Model (Est. 3-6 Months)
    Objective: Fix data gaps and build a robust baseline model.
    Key Actions:
        Secure Real Data: Forge partnerships with agencies (e.g., PMD, WAPDA) to get API access to real-time river discharge, soil moisture, and snowpack data.
        Expand Ground Truth: Increase the historical flood event database from 7 to several hundred, refining the labeling logic for greater precision.
        Refactor Pipeline: Integrate new data sources and enhance the feature engineering process.
    Phase 2: MLOps Automation & Scaling (Est. 4-6 Months)
    Objective: Automate the pipeline for reliability and continuous improvement.
    Key Actions:
        Orchestrate Workflows: Use tools like Apache Airflow to fully automate the data collection and model retraining schedules.
        Implement Monitoring: Build dashboards to monitor for performance degradation and data drift, with triggers for automatic retraining.
        Establish CI/CD: Create CI/CD pipelines to safely test and deploy new model versions.
    Phase 3: Productization & Deployment (Est. 4-7 Months)
    Objective: Create user-facing tools for real-world impact.
    Key Actions:
        Develop API: Build a secure, documented API to serve predictions.
        Build Frontend: Create a web-based dashboard with a map interface for officials to visualize risk.
        Create Alerting System: Integrate with SMS gateways or push notification services to warn residents in high-risk zones.
